@article{Inomata2001,
abstract = {Magnetic random access memory (MRAM) possesses the attractive properties of non-volatility, radiation hardness, nondestructive readout, low voltage, high access speed, unlimited read and write endurance and high density. MRAM technology is described for the devices using giant magnetoresistance (GMR) and tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) materials in this paper. The TMR type MRAM architectures using ferromagnetic tunneling junctions (MTJ) are more attractive for mainstream RAM applications than the GMR type, because the signal of the TMR type is larger than that of the GMR type. A MRAM device with an MTJ plus MOS transistor switch architecture, which can provide large signal-to noise ratio, is detailed. A design of the MTJ element is discussed and the requirements for the junction resistance and the TMR needed for the memory device are demonstrated based on the simple signal voltage calculations. The TMR significantly decreases with increasing bias voltage, which leads to the reduction of the signal voltage for the actual MRAM. A ferromagnetic double tunneling junction is proposed for the high density MRAM application demanding large signal voltage, because of the smaller degradation of the TMR for the bias voltage, compared with that of the conventional single junctions. Recent trials of MRAM fabrication are introduced, which demonstrates high-speed access time. Finally, challenges for the higher bit density MRAM above Gb are discussed, and it is noticed that higher signal voltage, lower power consumption for writing and novel cell designs are needed for the achievement.},

abstract = {The first-principles band theory paradigm has been a key player not only in the process of discovering new classes of topologically interesting materials, but also for identifying salient characteristics of topological states, enabling direct and sharpened confrontation between theory and experiment. We begin this review by discussing underpinnings of the topological band theory, which basically involves a layer of analysis and interpretation for assessing topological properties of band structures beyond the standard band theory construct. Methods for evaluating topological invariants are delineated, including crystals without inversion symmetry and interacting systems. The extent to which theoretically predicted properties and protections of topological states have been verified experimentally is discussed, including work on topological crystalline insulators, disorder/interaction driven topological insulators (TIs), topological superconductors, Weyl semimetal phases, and topological phase transitions. Successful strategies for new materials discovery process are outlined. A comprehensive survey of currently predicted 2D and 3D topological materials is provided. This includes binary, ternary and quaternary compounds, transition metal and f-electron materials, Weyl and 3D Dirac semimetals, complex oxides, organometallics, skutterudites and antiperovskites. Also included is the emerging area of 2D atomically thin films beyond graphene of various elements and their alloys, functional thin films, multilayer systems, and ultra-thin films of 3D TIs, all of which hold exciting promise of wide-ranging applications. We conclude by giving a perspective on research directions where further work will broadly benefit the topological materials field.},

This is the damping torque term known as Gilbert damping and its direction is given by the vector product of the magnetization and its time derivative. Here we derive the Gilbert term from first-principles by a nonrelativistic expansion of the Dirac equation. We find that this term arises when one calculates the time evolution of the spin observable in the presence of the full spin-orbital coupling terms, while recognizing the relationship between the curl of the electric field and the time-varying magnetic induction. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The purpose of this article is to review the current status of a frontier in dynamic spintronics and contemporary magnetism, in which much progress has been made in the past decade, based on the creation of a variety of micro and nanostructured devices that enable electrical detection of magnetization dynamics. The primary focus is on the physics of spin rectification effects, which are well suited for studying magnetization dynamics and spin transport in a variety of magnetic materials and spintronic devices. Intended to be intelligible to a broad audience, the paper begins with a pedagogical introduction, comparing the methods of electrical detection of charge and spin dynamics in semiconductors and magnetic materials respectively. After that it provides a comprehensive account of the theoretical study of both the angular dependence and line shape of electrically detected ferromagnetic resonance (FMR), which is summarized in a handbook format easy to be used for analysing experimental data. We then review and examine the similarity and differences of various spin rectification effects found in ferromagnetic films, magnetic bilayers and magnetic tunnel junctions, including a discussion of how to properly distinguish spin rectification from the spin pumping/inverse spin Hall effect generated voltage. After this we review the broad applications of rectification effects for studying spin waves, nonlinear dynamics, domain wall dynamics, spin current, and microwave imaging. We also discuss spin rectification in ferromagnetic semiconductors. The paper concludes with both historical and future perspectives, by summarizing and comparing three generations of FMR spectroscopy which have been developed for studying magnetization dynamics.},

@article{Avci2014f,
abstract = {We present harmonic transverse voltage measurements of current-induced thermoelectric and spin-orbit torque (SOT) effects in ferromagnet/normal-metal bilayers, in which thermal gradients produced by Joule heating and SOT coexist and give rise to ac transverse signals with comparable symmetry and magnitude. Based on the symmetry and field dependence of the transverse resistance, we develop a consistent method to separate thermoelectric and SOT measurements. By addressing first ferromagnet/light-metal bilayers with negligible spin-orbit coupling, we show that in-plane current injection induces a vertical thermal gradient whose sign and magnitude are determined by the resistivity difference and stacking order of the magnetic and nonmagnetic layers. We then study ferromagnet/heavy-metal bilayers with strong spin-orbit coupling, showing that second harmonic thermoelectric contributions to the transverse voltage may lead to a significant overestimation of the antidamping SOT. We find that thermoelectric effects are very strong in Ta(6 nm)/Co(2.5 nm) and negligible in Pt(6 nm)/Co(2.5 nm) bilayers. After including these effects in the analysis of the transverse voltage, we find that the antidamping SOTs in these bilayers, after normalization to the magnetization volume, are comparable to those found in thinner Co layers with perpendicular magnetization, whereas the fieldlike SOTs are about an order of magnitude smaller.},

We describe four terms (the inelastic mean free path, the effective attenuation length, the mean escape depth, and the information depth) that are commonly used as descriptors of the surface sensitivity of an XPS experiment. Due to the complicating effects of elastic scattering, numerical values for each measure are generally different. Analytical formulae are given for each quantity. We describe procedures for determination of surface composition (with an emphasis on three types of relative sensitivity factors), measurements of overlayer-film thickness, and determination of composition-versus-depth information from angle-resolved XPS. Information is given on measurements of photoelectron intensities and the effects of sample morphology and sample roughness. Sources of data are given for all parameters needed for quantitative XPS.

@article{Seah1980,
abstract = {A general framework is presented for the quantitative analysis of surfaces by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS or ESCA). The approach starts by considering analysis using reference data recorded on the same instrument and under identical conditions as the analysed sample. Matrix factors are evaluated and the quantification for adsorbed layers and sputter profiles discussed. More popularly reference data are not recorded each time but are taken from the published literature. In this case the angular anisotropy term and analyser transmission functions need to be known. These are discussed and the analyser transfer functions of commercial spectrometers are presented in detail. Nine published reference data sets are assessed to test their correlation with the theoretical predictions. Three sets are found to give moderate agreement but agree more closely with each other in their divergence from the theory for particular elements. This divergence enables a peak intensity factor to be defined which quantifies the intensity lost from a peak due to shake-up events, etc. With this factor and the analyser transfer functions quantification can be made to an accuracy of 10{\%} in all instruments from a single reference data set.},
