abstract = {Weyl semimetals (WSMs) exhibit an electronic structure governed by linear band dispersions and degenerate (Weyl) points that lead to exotic physical phenomena. While WSMs were established in bulk monopnictide compounds several years ago, the growth of thin films remains a challenge. Here, we report the bottom-up synthesis of single-crystalline NbP and TaP thin films, 9 to 70 nm thick, by means of molecular beam epitaxy. The as-grown epitaxial films feature a phosphorus-rich stoichiometry, a tensile-strained unit cell, and a homogeneous surface termination, unlike their bulk crystal counterparts. These properties result in an electronic structure governed by topological surface states as directly observed using in situ momentum photoemission microscopy, along with a Fermi-level shift of -0.2 eV with respect to the intrinsic chemical potential. Although the Fermi energy of the as-grown samples is still far from the Weyl points, carrier mobilities close to 103 cm2/(V s) have been measured at room temperature in patterned Hall-bar devices. The ability to grow thin films of Weyl semimetals that can be tailored by doping or strain, is an important step toward the fabrication of functional WSM-based devices and heterostructures.},

@article{PandeyaTaW,
abstract = {As spintronic devices become more and more prevalent, the desire to find Pt-free materials with large spin Hall effects is increasing. Previously it was shown that $\beta$-W, the metastable A15 structured variant of pure W, has charge-spin conversion efficiencies on par with Pt, and it was predicted that $\beta$-W/Ta alloys should be even more efficient. Here we demonstrate the enhancement of the spin Hall ratio (SHR) in A15-phase $\beta$-W films doped with Ta (W 4−x Ta x where x = 0.34 ± 0.06) deposited at room temperature using DC magnetron co-sputtering. In close agreement with theoretical predictions, we find that the SHR of the doped films was ∼9{\%} larger than pure $\beta$-W films. We also found that the SHR's in devices with Co 2 Fe 6 B 2 were nearly twice as large as the SHR's in devices with Co 4 Fe 4 B 2. This work shows that by optimizing deposition parameters and substrates, the fabrication of the optimum W 3 Ta alloy should be feasible, opening the door to commercially viable, Pt-free, spintronic devices.},

@article{PandeyaSnSe,
abstract = {2D SnTe films with a thickness of as little as 2 atomic layers (ALs) have recently been shown to be ferroelectric with in-plane polarization. Remarkably, they exhibit transition temperatures (Tc) much higher than that of bulk SnTe. Here, combining molecular beam epitaxy, variable temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, and ab initio calculations, the underlying mechanism of the Tc enhancement is unveiled, which relies on the formation of $\gamma$-SnTe, a van der Waals orthorhombic phase with antipolar inter-layer coupling in few-AL thick SnTe films. In this phase, 4n − 2 AL (n = 1, 2, 3{\ldots}) thick films are found to possess finite in-plane polarization (space group Pmn21), while 4n AL thick films have zero total polarization (space group Pnma). Above 8 AL, the $\gamma$-SnTe phase becomes metastable, and can convert irreversibly to the bulk rock salt phase as the temperature is increased. This finding unambiguously bridges experiments on ultrathin SnTe films with predictions of robust ferroelectricity in GeS-type monochalcogenide monolayers. The observed high transition temperature, together with the strong spin-orbit coupling and van der Waals structure, underlines the potential of atomically thin $\gamma$-SnTe films for the development of novel spontaneous polarization-based devices.},
