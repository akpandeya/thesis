\section{Growth of \nbse}

\nbse was grown using Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on c-plane of sapphire substrate from Crystec. The substrate was 
cleaned using modified RCA method as described in \tref{cleaning-al2o3} and loaded in the selenide chamber of \papaya\ 
where it was degassed at \temperature{700} for about 1 hour. Nb and Se are co evaoparoated from e-beam and K-cells respectively
such that ther flx ratio is 1:20. The first 3 monolayers (MLs) were grown at \temperature{570} and all the subsequent 
layers were grown at \temperature{650}. The deposited sample was annealed at \temperature{700} for the first time after 
deposition of 3 ML and then intermittently after every 10-15 MLs. The growth is monitored continuously using RHEED and the
the stoichiometry and morphology is assessed intermittently using XPS and STM respectively. Once the sample is taken out 
of the chamber its structure is assessed using XRD and Raman.


\subsection{Cleaning \alumina substrate}
\tlabel{cleaning-al2o3}

The substrates which we recieve from the suppliers usually have both metallic and organic impurities on them. The AFM of
the substrate as recieved from the supplier is shown in \tref{afm-rec-al2o3} The recipe for cleaning the substrate is as follows:

    \tlabel{fig:afm-al2o3}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Soak the substrate in ethanol for 12 hours.
    \item Clean the substrate in ultrasonic bath of acetone and Isopropanol for 5 minutes each to remove 
    bulky dissolvable contaminants and particulates materials.
    \item Rinse thoroughly in deionized (DI) water thoroughly and blow with dry nitrogen gas.
    \item Heat the substrate in \ammonia\ : \peroxide\ :  \water\ = 1 : 1 : 5 to about \temperature{80} for 10 minutes \ammoniumion in the 
    cleaning solution will complex with heavy metal on the substrate surface to form a soluble metal salts which is removed.
    \item Rinse thoroughly in DI water thoroughly and dry with pure nitrogen gas.
    \item Soak the substrate in solution of \hcl\ : \peroxide\ : \water\ = 1: 1: 3 at about \temperature{80} for 10 minutes \hydrogenion\ ion 
    in the cleaning solution will replace with the light metal impurities to form soluble salt and be removed.
    \item Rinse thoroughly in DI water thoroughly and dry with pure nitrogen gas.
    \item Clean in \sulphuricacid\ : \phosphoricacid\ = 1 : 3 at about \temperature{80} for 10min to move the oxide layer on the sapphire substrate
    \item Rinse thoroughly in DI water thoroughly and dry with pure nitrogen gas.
    \item After drying the sapphire substrate anneal at \temperature{1200} for 4h preferably, but not necessarily, in the \oxygen\ atmosphere.
\end{enumerate}



We are able to get rid of the impurities after chemically cleaning it as can be seen in \tref{afm-clean-al2o3}.
The terraces of the substrate are visible in \tref{fig:afm-al2o3} after annealing it in \oxygen\ atmosphere.
The width of the terraces is dependent on the miscut angle of the substrate. Lower the miscut angle, 
wider the terraces. The cleaned substrate was then loaded into the selenide chamber of PAPAYA where 
it was first degassed at \temperature{700} for about 1 hour. The substrate surface is now ready for growth of \nbse. \\

The growth of any thin film using MBE can be affected by two major factors:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item temperature of the substrate and
    \item flux ratio of the elements of the film
\end{enumerate}
I will discuss their effect on growth of NbSe2 film one by one.

\end{figure}


99.999\% pure Nb was evaporated using an e-beam cell and Se was evaporated using 
K-cell with a flux ratio >1:20. The interfacial layer of \nbse grrow best around 
\tempError{570}{20}. When the temperature < \temperature{500}, we get polycrystal
sample and when the temperature > \temperature{650} the island growth starts. But
the subsequent layers do not grow well at the same temperature. In order to avoid,
stranski-Krostanov growth all the subsequent layers must be grown at \tempError{650}{20}.
The first ~3 monolayer (ML) is grown at \tempError{570}{20} and all the subsequent layers 
are grown at \tempError{650}{20} \tref{rheed-NbSe2-growth-algo} and 
\tref{rheed-NbSe2-optimization}. The deposited sample is annealed at \tempError{700}{20} 
for the first time after deposition of 3 ML and then intermittently after every 10-15 ML.

Long streaky RHEED patterns of the (0001) Al2O3 in \dirx\ and \diry\ directions were observed 
indicating a flat and crystalline substrate surface  (\tref{rheed-al2o3-10-10} and 
\tref{rheed-al2o3-11-20}).  As the growth of forst monolayer completes the RHEED appears a 
bit diffused(\tref{rheed-NbSe2-begin-10-10} and \tref{rheed-NbSe2-begin-11-20}) but as 
the growth progresses the patter becomse streakier (\tref{rheed-NbSe2-10-10} and 
\tref{rheed-NbSe2-11-20}).It means that the grain size increases as the film grows thicker  
because of increased coalescence. The in-plane lattice parameter for this film 
is estimated to be \aerr{3.46}{0.03} using RHEED.

We characterized the sample using X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman Spectroscopy after taking it out of the growth chamber.
