\addchapter{Growth and characterization of weyl semimetals}
\label{growth_of_wsm}

Weyl semimetals in this study were  grown using Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on c-plane 
of MgO substrate from Crystec. The substrate was cleaned using methanol
as described in \tref{wsm-substrate} and loaded in \tamarind where it was degassed 
at \temperature{550} for about 1 hour. Nb(Ta) and P are co evaoparoated 
from e-beam and K-cells respectively such that ther flx ratio is 1:20. The growth is 
monitored continuously using RHEED and the stoichiometry and morphology is assessed 
intermittently using XPS. Once the sample is taken out of the chamber its structure is 
assessed using XRD.

The choice of substrate which is lattice matched to Nb(Ta)P is a bit limited by the 
fact that we need insulating substrate for fabricating electrical and spintronic 
devices. MgO is one such substrate which can easily be treated to become atomically
flat and is lattice matched to [100] direction of NbP with [110] direction in the
substrate as shown in \tref{structure-wsm} and tabulated in \tref{wsm-lattice-table}

\section{Substrate preparation}

Nb(Ta)P were grown in TAMARIND using MBE on MgO substrates, usually 5$\text(\times)$10 mm in 
size from the supplier Crystec. The substrate was prepared for growth as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Soak the substrate in methanol for 20 minutes.
    \item Rinse thoroughly in deionized (DI) water thoroughly and blow with dry nitrogen gas.
    \item Anneal the substrate in O2 atmosphere at \temperature{1050 - 1100} for 3 h.
\end{enumerate}

The process is not fully reproducible. Most of the times we would get atomically flat substrates 
but occasionally we would see pits and sometimes the terrace are not of atomic step height. 
The representative figure of both such scenarios have been shown in \tref{afm-MgO-pits} and
\tref{afm-MgO-usable}  with their line scans shown \tref{afm-MgO-pits-ls} and \tref{afm-MgO-usable-ls}

\section{Evaporation of materials}

Ta(Nb) is evaporated from a rod using electron-beam heating and P is evaporated using a 
GaP effusion cell at \temperature{850}in TAMARIND chamber. The residual P in the chamber sticks to 
the chamber in two major allotropic forms, \ptwo (red Phosphorous) and \pfour (white 
phosphorous). The red phosphorus is thermodynamically stable at room temperature but 
white phosphorous can spontaneously combust at room temperature and turn in lethal phosphine 
\phosphine gas. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to keep the white phosphorus
concentration to as low value as possible. We observe that the ration of 
\ptwo : \pfour is around 1:100.

\section{Growth of Nb(Ta)P}


There is more than 10\% mismatch between the lattice parameters of Nb(Ta)P and MgO.
If we try to grow these compounds directly on the substrate, the film does not remain 
crystalline; we start getting islands of these films instead of single crystalline flat 
films.  It turns out that if we grow a buffer layer of Nb(Ta) before the growth of 
phosphide, we get high quality single crystalline films. This buffer layer is grown at 
\temperature{300}, at a rate of 3-5 nm/h and a pressure of \pressure{4}{-10}. The surface 
of the buffer layer is then exposed to a P2 flux (BEP: \pressure{1}{-8}) to achieve phosphorization.
Once the buffer layer has been phosphorized the surface is ready for growth of Nb(Ta)P. 
The substrate temperature is maintained between \temperature{300} to \temperature{400} and the film is grown at a 
slow rate of < 4nm/h which is limited by the Nb (Ta) flux. The P flux is at least 20 times 
higher than the Nb flux and has BEP of \pressure{1}{-8}. The sample is cooled down at the rate of 
10 \degree C/min in P-atmosphere, to ensure that P-termination surface is homogeneous.

The film quality is constantly monitored using in-situ reflection high energy electron diffraction 
(RHEED) with 15 kV energy and 1.5 mA filament current. We take an atomically flat terraced MgO 
substrate (\tref{rheed-MgO-100} and \tref{rheed-MgO-110}) and grow a Nb (Ta) buffer layer on it 
in order to minimize the lattice mismatch. These layers are rotated 45\degree\ with respect to 
each other i.e. \direction{100} direction of MgO points along the \plane{110} plane of Nb (Ta) 
as seen in \tref{rheed-Nb-100} and \tref{rheed-Nb-110}. Before starting the growth of Nb(Ta)P 
we phosphorize the surface in order to minimize the thickness of the buffer layer. The higher 
order streaks appear during this process and the RHEED pattern becomes a bit more diffusive as 
shown in \tref{rheed-NbP-100-begin} and \tref{rheed-NbP-110-begin}. It suggests that the grain 
size is not very large yet. Once the growth starts and grains start to coalesce the RHEED pattern 
becomes very streaky which suggests that the film starts to follow the terraces of the substrate. 
The periodic RHEED reflections are only visible in the high symmetry directions (45\degree\ 
periodicity), while there are no coherent patterns at intermediate angles, indicating that the 
NbP (TaP) films grow with a single-crystalline orientation without twinning/twisting of in-plane 
crystalline domains (\tref{rheed-NbP-100} and \tref{rheed-NbP-110}).

A standard $\theta - 2\theta$ confirms an epitaxial, single crystalline film with no other phases
because only (004) and (008) Nb(Ta)P reflections visible in the scan of Nb(Ta)P films of 
various thicknesses (9-70 nm). The reciprocal space mapping of the Nb(Ta)P shows that the in-plane
lattice parameter is $a=3.391 \angstrom$. The strain of the film does not change much with the thickness
because we can observe that the in-plane parameters do not change when the thickness of the film
changes. The out of plane lattice parameters change from $c=11.50 \angstrom$ to $c=11.46 \angstrom$
as the thickness of film increase to upto 70 nm. It means that the film grows is fully relaxed right
from the start of the film growth. The lattice parameters of these films are, however, substantially different fromt the
bulk values ($a=3.34 \angstrom, c=11.37 \angstrom$).

The topography of Nb(Ta)P films is extremely important ot study SOT properties as well as the 
bandstructure of these films. The film follows the step-flow growth i.e. the grains on steps and follow
the steps of the substrate (\tref{afm-wsm}). The film is very flat and show root mean sqaured (RMS) 
roughness ofabout 0.43 nm. The step-height at the inter-grain boundary corresponds to the thickness 
of a unit cell of Nb(Ta)P. But the step-height at all the terraces is around 2.8 \angstrom which 
corresponds to one-fourth of the unit-cell height. We can also see the zoomed in version of the 
afm topography in \tref{{afm-NbP}} and \tref{{afm-TaP}} and the width of terrace is greater of 
NbP.

The stoichiometry and valence states of the NbP (TaP) thin films have
been studied by in-situ X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and ex-situ 
Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS).  The Nb 3d 5/2 and P 2p core 
level peaks in XPS spectra is shown in \tref{xps-wsm}. The figure shows that Nb 
and P peaks shift in opposite directions compared to the neutral Nb0 and P0 
valence state. This is consistent with the expected chemical shifts due to 
electron transfer from Nb to P atom. The stoichiometry  of the films has been 
determined using equation \cref{es:binding}, yielding a slightly P-rich 
(Nb0.49 P0.51) composition. In addition to XPS, which is a surface sensitive technique,
the in-depth composition of the films has been studied by Rutherford backscattering 
spectroscopy (RBS). The best fitting to the rbs spectra shown in \tref{rbs-wsm}, gives a 
47.6\% to 52.4\% (Nb:P) composition, indicating that the P-rich composition 
is distributed homogeneously across the full NbP layer.

Having assessed the properties of the film surface, momentum-resolved 
photoemission spectra have been taken using an in-house designed and built 
momentum microscope45 with a He-I light source. Figure 5 summarizes the
overall electronic structure of a 15 nm-thick NbP thin film measured at 
100K, including Fermi-surface topology and band dispersion along relevant 
(Weyl point) cuts, together with ab-initio calculations using the experimentally 
obtained unit cell parameters. At the Fermi-energy, four electronic pockets with 
an elliptic shape directed towards the X and Y symmetry points can be identified, 
as shown in Fig. 5a.  A detailed comparison with the calculation of the 
termination-dependent surface states (Figures 5b and 5c) reveal that the elliptic 
and cross-like band features along $\Gamma-X$ and $\Gamma-Y$ are characteristic of the P-terminated 
NbP surface states (the features for a Nb-termination are radically different). 
Interestingly, the size and shape of the measured elliptical (also called spoon-like) 
features match with the calculations and the bulk crystal data in Refs.10,11,46 only 
when an energy shift of $\Delta E = 0.2 \text{eV}$. is considered (highlighted 
in a green box, Figure 5b), suggesting an effective hole doping in the as-grown 
thin films.  Figure 5d shows the energy dispersion cut along $A \rightarrow A'$, 
which is expected to cross the location of one pair of Weyl-points in NbP 
($k_x=0.54 \angstrom^{-1}, E_b = -0.026 eV$) and thus used to visualize the surface 
Fermi arcs. A clear linear band dispersion is observed, in agreement with previous 
photoemission results of cleaved monopnictide bulk crystals.6-11  This dispersion 
originates from the Fermi-arcs, but their kx-ky contour at the Weyl points cannot 
be mapped in our NbP films due to the EF shift (-0.2 eV) with respect to the intrinsic 
Fermi-level, and secondly, due the intrinsically short separation of the Weyl points 
in momentum space ($\Delta k < 0.05 \angstrom-1$), a detection challenge even for high-resolution 
synchrotron ARPES. It is noteworthy that only these topological surface states (elliptic 
shape, $A \rightarrow A'$ cut) are observed in our films, whereas the bowtie features
centered at the X and Y points) are completely absent.  This merits further investigation
and will be discussed elsewhere. On the other hand, the origin of the effective hole-doping 
in the as-grown thin films can be attributed to residual acceptors (Nb-vacancies) arising 
from the MBE growth process, in agreement with the slightly P-rich composition of the films 
inferred by XPS and RBS.  The strained lattice parameters of the phosphide thin films 
will also have an effect on the Fermi-level position. Although we estimate that the effect 
of the lattice parameters (~1\% tensile strain) is rather small, further studies are needed 
to disentangle the contribution from strain and vacancy acceptors on EF, in order to get a 
full understanding of Fermi-level engineering of Weyl semimetals achieved by epitaxial design.
