\addchap{Abstract}

In this thesis, I prepare epitaxial thin films of the transition metal dichalcogenide
\nbse and Weyl semimetals (NbP and TaP), via molecular beam epitaxy. Their crystal structure
is characterized by Reflection High Energy Electron Diffraction, x-ray diffraction, 
transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The stoichiometry of the films  
is assessed using X-Ray photo electron spectroscopy and Rutherford back scattering spectroscopy.
\\

The electrical properties of the thin films are investigated using physical property
measurement system (ppms) on the lihographically fabricated devices. Finally, I make 
heterstructures of these thin films with permalloy and estimate the spin to charge conversion
efficiency using spin torque ferromagnetic resonance at room temperature.
